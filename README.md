### Instructions for Every Challenge

Before **every challenge**, clone down this repo using the `git clone` command and the Clone SSH link. This is important - we need you to have a clean repo to work from. _Do not use your old clones of this repo!_

`cd` into the directory of your current code challenge.

Create and checkout a new branch using your first and last name: `git checkout -b bartelby-cumberbuttons`

Push your branch: `git push origin bartelby-cumberbuttons`

Your instructor will confirm that your branch was pushed successfully. Once all branches appear, your instructor will ask you to start work on the challenge.

At the end of the challenge, make your final commit and push your branch.
